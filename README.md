### Hi!, I'm Hüseyin, I am studying at the IT faculty of AzTU (Azerbaijan Technical University). I am also a person who is trying to learn the computer field and improve myself in this potential over time. So far, I have been involved in many jobs, including web development, and over time, I have been exploring other fields and working as a computer person. You can see the information I have mentioned and also the projects I have written about, using the fields I have been involved in so far. But I still have little knowledge about these sectors and I want to research more information and prepare projects related to these sectors. Therefore, I am still trying to improve my level as a player
